# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
    
    I wanted to build this project in order to familiarize myself with the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It helps me put in one place, some of the important things I have learned throughout the prework. Through it I've learned syntax for HTML, CSS, Git, and JS.

    The study guide can be used to review some of the topics I've learned during prework. You can also open up the DevTools console on Chrome to get a list of the topics and have one randomly chosen for you as a starting point for studying.
